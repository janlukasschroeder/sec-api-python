## Installation

```bash

```

Get your free API key on [sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with it.

## SEC EDGAR Filings Query API

The Query API allows you to search and filter all 18 million filings and exhibits published on SEC EDGAR using a large set of search parameters. You can search by ticker, CIK, form type, filing date, SIC code, period of report, series and class IDs, items of 8-K and other filings, and many more. The API returns all filing metadata in a [standardized JSON format](https://sec-api.io/docs/query-api#response-format). Filings are indexed and searchable as soon as they are published on SEC EDGAR. Various examples are provided below, in the [official documentation](https://sec-api.io/docs/query-api), and in our [sandbox](https://sec-api.io/sandbox).

---

The example below retrieves all 10-Q filings filed by TSLA in 2020.

```python
from sec_api import QueryApi

queryApi = QueryApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

query = {
  "query": "ticker:TSLA AND filedAt:[2020-01-01 TO 2020-12-31] AND formType:\"10-Q\"",
  "from": "0",
  "size": "10",
  "sort": [{ "filedAt": { "order": "desc" } }]
}

filings = queryApi.get_filings(query)

print(filings)
```

Fetch most recent 8-Ks with Item 9.01 "Financial Statements and Exhibits".

```python
query = {
  "query": "formType:\"8-K\" AND items:\"9.01\"",
  "from": "0",
  "size": "10",
  "sort": [{ "filedAt": { "order": "desc" } }]
}

filings = queryApi.get_filings(query)
```

### 13F Institutional Investor Database

Fetch most recent 13F filings that hold Tesla.

```python
query = {
  "query": "formType:\"13F\" AND holdings.ticker:TSLA",
  "from": "0",
  "size": "10",
  "sort": [{ "filedAt": { "order": "desc" } }]
}

filings = queryApi.get_filings(query)
```

> See the documentation for more details: https://sec-api.io/docs/query-api

## SEC EDGAR Filings Real-Time Stream API

The Stream API provides a live stream (aka feed) of newly published filings on SEC EDGAR via WebSockets.
A new filing is sent to your connected client as soon as it is published.

---

Install the `websockets` client:

```bash
pip install websockets
```

Run the example script below. Get your free API key on [sec-api.io](https://sec-api.io) and replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with it.

```python
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY" # Replace this with your actual API key
SERVER_URL = "wss://stream.sec-api.io"
WS_ENDPOINT = SERVER_URL + "?apiKey=" + API_KEY

async def websocket_client():
    try:
        async with websockets.connect(WS_ENDPOINT) as websocket:
            print("âœ… Connected to:", SERVER_URL)

            while True:
                message = await websocket.recv()
                filings = json.loads(message)
                for f in filings:
                    print(f["accessionNo"], f["formType"], f["filedAt"], f["cik"])

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")


asyncio.run(websocket_client())
```

> See the documentation for more details: https://sec-api.io/docs/stream-api

## Full-Text Search API

Full-text search allows you to search the full text of all EDGAR filings submitted since 2001. The full text of a filing includes all data in the filing itself as well as all attachments (such as exhibits) to the filing.

---

The example below returns all 8-K and 10-Q filings and their exhibits, filed between 01-01-2021 and 14-06-2021, that include the exact phrase "LPCN 1154".

```python
from sec_api import FullTextSearchApi

fullTextSearchApi = FullTextSearchApi(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

query = {
  "query": '"LPCN 1154"',
  "formTypes": ['8-K', '10-Q'],
  "startDate": '2021-01-01',
  "endDate": '2021-06-14',
}

filings = fullTextSearchApi.get_filings(query)

print(filings)
```

> See the documentation for more details: https://sec-api.io/docs/full-text-search-api

## XBRL-To-JSON Converter API

Parse and standardize any XBRL and convert it to JSON or pandas dataframes. Extract financial statements and meta data from 10-K and 10-Q filings.

The entire US GAAP taxonomy is fully supported. All XBRL items are fully converted into JSON, including `us-gaap`, `dei` and custom items. XBRL facts are automatically mapped to their respective context including period instants and date ranges.

All financial statements are accessible and standardized:

- StatementsOfIncome
- StatementsOfIncomeParenthetical
- StatementsOfComprehensiveIncome
- StatementsOfComprehensiveIncomeParenthetical
- BalanceSheets
- BalanceSheetsParenthetical
- StatementsOfCashFlows
- StatementsOfCashFlowsParenthetical
- StatementsOfShareholdersEquity
- StatementsOfShareholdersEquityParenthetical

Variants such as `ConsolidatedStatementsofOperations` or `ConsolidatedStatementsOfLossIncome` are automatically standardized to their root name, e.g. `StatementsOfIncome`.

### Income Statement - Example Item

```json
{
  "StatementsOfIncome": {
    "RevenueFromContractWithCustomerExcludingAssessedTax": [
      {
        "decimals": "-6",
        "unitRef": "usd",
        "period": {
          "startDate": "2019-09-29",
          "endDate": "2020-09-26"
        },
        "value": "274515000000"
      },
      {
        "decimals": "-6",
        "unitRef": "usd",
        "period": {
          "startDate": "2018-09-30",
          "endDate": "2019-09-28"
        },
        "value": "260174000000"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Usage

There are 3 ways to convert XBRL to JSON:

- `htm_url`: Provide the URL of the filing ending with `.htm`.
  Example URL: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231.htm
- `xbrl_url`: Provide the URL of the XBRL file ending with `.xml`. The XBRL file URL can be found in the `dataFiles` array returned by our query API. The array item has the description `EXTRACTED XBRL INSTANCE DOCUMENT` or similar.
  Example URL: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231_htm.xml
- `accession_no`: Provide the accession number of the filing, e.g. `0001564590-21-004599`

```python
from sec_api import XbrlApi

xbrlApi = XbrlApi("YOUR_API_KEY")

# 10-K HTM File URL example
xbrl_json = xbrlApi.xbrl_to_json(
    htm_url="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019320000096/aapl-20200926.htm"
)

# access income statement, balance sheet and cash flow statement
print(xbrl_json["StatementsOfIncome"])
print(xbrl_json["BalanceSheets"])
print(xbrl_json["StatementsOfCashFlows"])

# 10-K XBRL File URL example
xbrl_json = xbrlApi.xbrl_to_json(
    xbrl_url="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459021004599/tsla-10k_20201231_htm.xml"
)

# 10-K accession number example
xbrl_json = xbrlApi.xbrl_to_json(accession_no="0001564590-21-004599")
```
